Web development today carries with it many security risks. 
Security vulnerabilities are 
often introduced inadvertenly as the result of bugs or poor design. 
This is due to the nature of web software, which often 
requires the interoperation of multiple technologies and code to
function. 
Wyvern is a proposed new language being developed that aims to make 
secure software the default. Wyvern introduces secure development 
practices as part of the language. This way we hope to make secure 
software easier to write by making the introduction certain vulnerabilities 
explicit. 
Wyvern also adds functionality for integrating software
written by many distributed people in a relatively safe manner.
For a new language to be useful to developers, a 
certain amount of flexibility must be maintained. We extend 
the existsing Wyvern language with the flexibility one would find 
in mainstream languages such as Java and C#.
