"pointsto(e, mu) = loc_set" means that in the context of memory mu, the expression e can directly access principals identified by locations in loc_set
"auth_store(l, mu) = loc_set" means that in the context of memory mu, the principal identified by l can directly access the other principals identified by locations in loc_set, by virtue of l's state
"auth_stack(l, e, mu) = loc_set" means that in the context of memory mu, the principal identified by l can directly access the other principals identified by locations in loc_set, by virtue of the execution state of methods of l executing in e
"auth(l, e, mu) = loc_set" means that in the context of memory mu, the principal identified by l can directly access the other principals identified by locations in loc_set
