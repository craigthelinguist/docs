Pure value: an object that has no state embedded within it, and does not enable access to any I/O effect
Pure module: a function that is a pure value, accepts only pure value arguments, and results in a pure value.  It may compute with state temporarily.

Checks for a pure value:
  case object:
    no vars
	defs/vals contain pure values
  case function:
    captures only pure values
		(implies no I/O effect by calling a captured function with an effect)
	is not native code with an I/O effect

Checks for a pure module:
	imports only other pure modules
	results in a pure value

Type system
	distinguish object and function types that are pure values from those that are not
