High-level goal:
	Be able to answer, for any module M and resource R,
	what is the permission or authority of M to act on resource R?

Definitions (multiple alternatives)
	act:
		calls
		dataflow
		affects (information flow/non-interference)
		
	permission: the ability to do something directly
	authority: the ability to make something happen, perhaps indirectly
		(the transitive version of permission)

	module: a body of source code
	
	resource:
		a module
		an object (more fine-grained)
		
	what:
		which operations on R?
		constraints on operation arguments?
		a component that mediates?
			(and implicitly constraints operations/arguments)
	
	answer
		one of several formal approaches
		human reasoning
		hybrids between the above

Ideas to demonstrate we can do this
	a logic that can express the questions we want to answer
	a set of formal reasoning principles based on capabilities
			for answering the questions
		- could be a logic, type system, or analysis
	evidence that humans can (perhaps informally) use the
		principles with and/or without automated support

Possible staging
	Stage 1:
		second-class modules
		focus on *permission* to make calls to resource module operations
			(enforced by import system)
	
	Stage 2:
		first-class modules
		reason about *authority* to make calls to resource module operations
		
	Extensions (arbitrary order)
		reason about mediation
		reason about non-interference/information flow
		reason about particular constraints on operations or operation arguments
		human reasoning based on capabilities
		hybrid human/type reasoning
		reason about object resources
