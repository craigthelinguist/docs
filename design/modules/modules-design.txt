m ::= h d*
h ::= a i* s?
i ::= requires module-sig-name [as X]
	import module-name [as X]
	instantiate module-name(name*) [as X]
a ::= [resource] module name
s ::= signature \tau
d ::= (ordinary declarations)


QUESTIONS
	want to look up names by URL eventually
		but can/must this be in a separate config file?
		maybe start by just making everything be a URL (simplest)
	what is a module-sig-name?
		does this require signatures as modules?
		can this be a type defined (and exported by) a module? (simplest)
	do we want to separate modules with code in them
		from modules that only do linking?
		no, for now (simplest)
	what argument(s) does a top-level module get?
		simplest: an FFI.  Everything else derives from this.
