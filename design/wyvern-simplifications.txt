Wyvern Design Considerations driven by example

Simple
 - type.wyv: can we eliminate lines 16-18 in practice?
 - separately, define parser declaratively
 - clean up if code in tokenizer.nextTok()
Jonathan
 - clean up parser
Think about
 - "import X" by default uses the wyv scheme and searches for an object named X in a file named X.wyv
 - allow a file X.wyv to define a class X in some parent module Y 
 - allow the definition of a constructor using the apply method of the class object
	- apply to tokenizer and parser
 - support properties
