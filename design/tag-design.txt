How tags on new should work
 - typechecking time: determine the type of a New expression
	- includes a structural part
	- includes information about the nominal part, if any
		- minimally, path.type where type is a nominal type decl
 - evaluation time:
	go to the type
		look up the nominal part of the type, if any
		if there is a nominal part, resolve the path to an instance
			(this may be the global instance)
		get the appropriate type declaration from the instance
		if it is tagged,
			the tag is a pair of the instance and type declaration
Consequence for types
	- must be able to get the nominal part, if any
	- from the nominal part, must be able to get the path
			(this may be the global instance)

Need a notion of run-time tag
	pair of a value and the name of a type declaration in it
	also knows its parent (if any)
