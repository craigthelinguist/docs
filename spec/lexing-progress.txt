JUnit status at start
	304 test cases run

TO DO
	X use indentation to determine when a DSL ends
	X track current indent level
	X add test cases for all parts of spec
		X including errors:
			X ~ not followed by indented line
			X indent decreased but not to a previous indent
			X indent increased but not to a superset of a previous indent
			X end program indented w/o a newline
		X other cases:
			X multi-line comment and indents
			X parentheses and indent
			X end of file in a DSL block
	X clean up code
	X investigate using as the basis for a full parser (w/o an intermediate layer)
		alternatively, investigate an interface that ANTLR or javacc could use...
	X fix bugs and check in
		
TO DO LATER
	make readme.txt in the tools directory
