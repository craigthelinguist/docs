\section{Triage}
Vital components: Paper. Soundness (10\%) and completeness (90\%) of instantiation, soundness of subtyping.
Less vital: Soundness and completeness of typing, completeness of subtyping (all 0\%).


Order of writing: Approach/Variable Bounds, Construction/Instantiation, Introduction, Approach, Prior Work, Verification
\section{Introduction}
Some work done, but rough.
\section{Prior Work}
Major prior contributions covered, could be expanded somewhat.
\section{Approach}
A couple of tries, none really pleasing. Explanation of bounding in particular needs work - figure?
\paragraph{Ordered Contexts}
Done, not particularly difficult.
\paragraph{Instantiation Judgements}
Repeat of Dunfield et al's discussion, with a minor alteration (subtype, not equality).
\paragraph{Variable Bounds}
No good version yet
\section{Construction}
\subsection{Grammar}
Boring.
\subsection{Bounding}
Move to after instantiation?
\subsection{Subtyping}
Boring.
\subsection{Instantiation}
Not very complete yet, same issue as the approach section.
\section{Verification}
Waiting on proof.
\subsection{Soundness}
\subsection{Completeness}
\subsection{Implementation}
