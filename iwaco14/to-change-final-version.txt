iwaco - stuff to change
=======================

describe attributes of Harry instead of Harry (Michael)

high-level comments from reviewer 1:
 - what does it mean to access: direct or indirect?
   - capability means right to access directly
   - authority means right to access indirectly
     - not reasoning about authority in this paper - hope to do so in a later work!
 - type-and-effect systems, e.g. FX or Idriss
 - co-monads: Aleks Nanevski Ph.D. thesis
 - are capabilities first-class values?  Effect on confused deputy, etc.
   - yes, they are; this supports flexibility, and allows first-class module instantiation
     - by a module that already has the requisite capabilities!
   - we do solve the problem of ambient capabilities
   - confused deputy, etc. remain problems
	but Miller argues that capabilities decrease them compared to ACLs
