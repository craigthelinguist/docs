iwaco - stuff to change
=======================


X high-level comments from reviewer 1:
 X what does it mean to access: direct or indirect?
   - capability means right to access directly
   - authority means right to access indirectly
     - not reasoning about authority in this paper - hope to do so in a later work!
 X type-and-effect systems, e.g. FX or Idriss
 - co-monads: Aleks Nanevski Ph.D. thesis
 X are capabilities first-class values?  Effect on confused deputy, etc.
   - yes, they are; this supports flexibility, and allows first-class module instantiation
     - by a module that already has the requisite capabilities!
   - we do solve the problem of ambient capabilities
   - confused deputy, etc. remain problems
	but Miller argues that capabilities decrease them compared to ACLs
	
My observations
 ? avoid SQL example as it does not fit with examples in the rest of the paper?
 X Centralized Architectural Specification - part E, who?
 X section 4, "explicit social delegation" - call it that?  order match section?
 - re-integrate Cyrus's SSLSOAPConnector text

describe attributes of Harry instead of Harry (Michael)


Thoughts on Scala (and related languages)
 - focus on scalable abstractions is exactly right
 - implicits are too implicit
 - I suspect complexity of the language and type system is a barrier to adoption
   - of course this is an empirical question! (but a hard one to answer)
