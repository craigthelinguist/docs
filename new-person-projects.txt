 * Defining and implementing a module system for Wyvern - we are likely to have something basic working by June but there are a number of features we could add which would be interesting research-wise and enhance the engineering benefits of the language.

 * A compiler targeting JavaScript and/or an interpreter for Wyvern written in JavaScript.  Our current tools are Java-based but we would like to be able to run Wyvern on a JavaScript platform.

 * Leveraging Wyvern's domain-specific language support to define a very simple framework for mobile application development.  Think of this as a layer that might sit on top of Android, iOS, or JavaScript.  The benefit would be that we could use Wyvern's language extension facilities to provide a very natural syntax for various framework files (e.g. replacing or compiling down to Android XML files) while also providing substantially more compile-time checking than is possible in current frameworks such as Android or iOS.
