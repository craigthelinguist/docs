\noindent Outline
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation
\begin{itemize}
\item Handlebars example, how injection attacks are possible there
\item (DONE)Comparison to Samuel paper
\item (DONE)Comparison to Livshit's paper
\item High level intro to our approach differentiating from the other two (automatic escaping)
\item (PARTIAL)List of contributions
- keep existing system, integration possible
- additional security guarantees
- concatenation of data from different sources (to compare to the two papers)
\end{itemize}
\item Approach
\begin{itemize}
\item Show how Handlebars can be put into Wyvern (Adding training wheels to handlebars): show example on Handlebars which is not secure but becomes secure in Wyvern
\item Talk about source sensitivity
\item Talk about safety
\item Conversion/Backward compatibility/Integration
\item If have space, ACE
\end{itemize}
\item {Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item From PLAS'13
\end{itemize}
\item Conclusion
