\section{Syntax}
\label{s:approach}

\subsection{Concrete Syntax}
\input{grammar}
We will now describe the concrete syntax of Wyvern declaratively, using the same layout-sensitive formalism that we have introduced for TSL grammars, developed recently by Adams \cite{Adams:2013:PPI:2429069.2429129}. Such a formalism is useful because it allows us to implement  layout-sensitive syntax, like that we've been describing, without relying on context-sensitive lexers or parsers. Most existing layout-sensitive languages (e.g. Python and Haskell) use hand-rolled context-sensitive lexers or parsers (keeping track of, for example, the indentation level using special \li{INDENT} and \li{DEDENT} tokens), but these are more problematic because they cannot be used to generate editor modes, syntax highlighters and other tools automatically. In particular, we will show how the forward references we have described can be correctly encoded without requiring a context-sensitive parser or lexer using this formalism. It is also useful that the TSL for \li{Parser}, above, uses the same parser technology as the host language, so that it can be used to generate quasiquotes.

Wyvern's concrete syntax, with a few minor omissions for concision, is shown in Figure~\ref{f-grammar}. We first review Adams' formalism in some additional detail, then describe some key features of this syntax.

\subsection{Background: Adams' Formalism}
For each terminal and non-terminal in a rule, Adams proposed associating with them a relational operator, such as =, > and $\geq$ to specify the indentation at which those terms need to be with respect to the non-terminal on the left-hand side of the rule. The indentation level of a term can be identified as the column at which the left-most character of that term appears (not simply the first character, in the case of terms that span multiple lines). The meaning of the comparison operators is akin to their mathematical meaning: = means that the term on the right-hand side has to be at exactly the same indentation as the term on the left-hand side; >  means that the term on the right-hand side has to be indented strictly further to the right than the term on the left-hand side; $\geq$ is like >, except the term on the right could also be at the same indentation level as the term on the left-hand side. For example, the production rule of the form \lstinline{A $\rightarrow$ B$^=$ C$^\geq$ D$^>$} approximately reads as: ``Term \lstinline{B} must be at the same indentation level as term \lstinline{A}, term \lstinline{C} may be at the same or a greater indentation level as term \lstinline{A}, and term \lstinline{D} must be at an indentation level greater than term \lstinline{A}'s.'' In particular, if \li{D} contains a \lstinline{NEWLINE} character, the next line must be indented past the position of the left-most character of \lstinline{A} (typically constructed so that it must appear at the beginning of a line). There are no constraints relating \lstinline{D} to \lstinline{B} or \lstinline{C} other than the standard sequencing constraint: the first character of \lstinline{D} must be further along in the file than the others. Using Adam's formalism, the grammars of real-world languages like Python and Haskell can be written declaratively. This formalism can be integrated into LR and LALR parser generators.

\caption{An example Wyvern program demonstrating forward references. The corresponding abstract syntax, where forward references are inlined, is on the right.}
\label{fig:fwd-ref}
\end{figure}
An example Wyvern program showing several unique syntactic features of TSL Wyvern is shown in Fig.~\ref{f-prelude}. The top level of a program (the \lstinline{p} non-terminal) consists of a series of type declarations -- object types using \lstinline{objtype} or case types using \lstinline{casetype} -- followed by an expression, \lstinline{e}. Each type declaration contains associated declarations -- signatures for fields and methods in  \lstinline{objdecls} and case declarations in \lstinline{casedecls}. Each also can also include a metadata declaration. Metadata is simply an expression associated with the type, used to store TSL logic (and in future work, other logic). Sequences of top-level declarations use the form \lstinline{p$^=$} to signify that all the succeeding \lstinline{p} terms must begin at the same indentation.

\subsection{Forward Referenced Blocks}
Wyvern makes extensive use of forward referenced blocks to make its syntax clean. In particular, layout-delimited TSLs, \keyw{new} expressions for creating objects, and the \keyw{case} statement for eliminating case types all use forward referenced blocks. Fig. \ref{fig:fwd-ref} shows all of these in use (assuming suitable definitions of casetypes \li{Nat} and \li{HTML}, not included). In the grammar, note particularly the rules for \li{let} and that inline literals, even those containing nested expressions with forward references, can be treated as expressions not containing forward references -- \emph{in the initial phase of parsing, before typechecking commences, all literal forms are left unparsed}.

\subsection{Abstract Syntax}
The concrete syntax of a Wyvern program, \li{p}, is parsed to produce a program in the abstract syntax, $\rho$, shown on the left side of Fig. \ref{fig:core2-syntax}. Forward references are internalized. In particular, note that all literal forms are unified into the abstract literal form $\lfloor body \rfloor$, including the layout-delimited form and number literals. The abstract syntax contains a form, $\keyw{fromTS}(e)$, that has no analog in the concrete syntax. This will be used internally to ensure hygiene, as we will discuss in the next section.

\section{Bidirectional Typechecking and Elaboration}
\label{s:statics}
We will now specify a type system for the abstract syntax in Fig. \ref{fig:core2-syntax}. Conventional type systems are specified using a typing judgement written like $\Gamma \vdash_{\Theta} e : \tau$, where the typing context, $\Gamma$, maps bound variables to types, and the named type context, $\Theta$, maps type names to their declarations. Typing judgements do not consider how, when writing a typechecker, it should be considered algorithmically: will a type be provided from the surrounding syntactic context (e.g. when the term appears as a function argument, or an explicit ascription has been provided), so that we simply need to \emph{analyze} $e$ against it, or do we need to \emph{synthesize} a type for $e$ (e.g. when the term appears at the  top-level)? Here, this distinction is crucial: a literal can only appear in an analytic context. 

\emph{Bidirectional type systems} \cite{Pierce:2000:LTI:345099.345100} make this distinction explicit by specifying the type system instead using two simultaneously defined typechecking judgements corresponding to these two situations. %In the latter situation, type annotations are unnecessary. 
For TSL Wyvern, we need to also simultaneously perform an elaboration of the external language, which contains literals, to an ``internal language'', $i$, the syntax for which is shown on the right side of Fig. \ref{fig:core2-syntax}. The internal language does not have literals, nor a form for accessing the metadata of a named type explicitly (the elaboration process inserts the statically known metadata value, tracked by the named type context, directly). The judgement $\Gamma \vdash_\Theta e \leadsto i \Rightarrow \tau$ means that under typing context $\Gamma$ and named type context $\Theta$, external term $e$ elaborates to internal term $i$ and synthesizes type $\tau$. The judgement $\Gamma \vdash_\Theta e \leadsto i \Leftarrow \tau$ is analagous but for situations where we are analyzing $e$ against type $\tau$. This manner of specifying a type-directed mapping from external terms to a smaller collection internal terms, which are the only terms that are given a dynamic semantics, is stylistically related to the Harper-Stone elaboration semantics for Standard ML \cite{Harper00atype-theoretic} so  our semantics for TSL Wyvern is a form of \emph{bidirectionally typed elaboration semantics}.% Note that both external and internal terms are classified by the same types (we will state this more precisely when we return to the metatheory in Sec. \ref{s:metatheory}).

The prelude $\Theta_0$ (see Fig. \ref{f-prelude}) defines mutually recursive types, so we cannot write a $\theta_0$ corresponding to $\Theta_0$ given the rules above. For concision, the rules to support mutual recursion as well as omitted rules for empty declarations are available in a technical report \cite{TR}.}

\subsection{Programs and Type Declarations}
Before considering these judgements in detail, let us briefly discuss the steps leading up to typechecking and elaboration of the top-level term, specified by the compilation judgement, $\rho \sim \Theta \leadsto i : \tau$, defined in Fig. \ref{f-statics-programs}. We first load the prelude, $\Theta_0$ (see Fig. \ref{f-prelude}),  then validate the provided user-defined type declarations, $\theta$, to produce a corresponding named typed context, $\Theta$. During this process, we synthesize a type for the associated metadata terms (under the empty typing context) and store their elaborations in the type context $\Theta$ (we do not evaluate the elaboration to a value immediately here, though in a language with effects, the choice of when to evaluate the term is important). Note that type names must be unique (we plan to use a URI-based mechanism in practice). Finally, the top-level external term must synthesize a type $\tau$ and produces an elaboration $i$ under an empty typing context and a named type context combining the prelude with the named type context induced by the user-defined types, written $\Theta_0 \Theta$.

The bidirectional typechecking and elaboration rules for external terms are shown beginning in Fig. \ref{fig:statics1}. Nearly all the rules are standard for simply typed lambda calculus with labeled sums and labeled products, and the elaborations are direct. We refer the reader to standard texts on type systems (e.g. \cite{pfpl}) to understand the basic constructs, and to course material\footnote{\small \url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15312-f04/handouts/15-bidirectional.pdf}} on bidirectional typechecking for background. In our presentation, all introductory forms are analytic and all elimination forms are synthetic. 

The introductory form for object types, $\keyw{enew}\,\{m\}$, prevents the manual introduction of parse streams (only the semantics can introduce parse streams, to permit us to enforce hygiene, as we will discuss below). The auxiliary judgement $\Gamma \vdash_\Theta^T m \leadsto \dot{m} \Leftarrow \omega$ analyzes the member definitions $m$ against the member declarations $\omega$ while rewriting them to the internal member definitions, $\dot{m}$. Method definitions involve a self-reference, so the judgement keeps track of the type  name, $T$. We implicitly assume that member definitions and declarations are congruent up to reordering.

The introduction form for case types is written $\keyw{einj}[C](e)$, where $C$ is the case name and $e$ is the associated data. The type of the data associated with each case is stored in the case type's declaration, $\chi$. Because the introductory form is analytic, multiple case types can use the same case names (unlike in, for example, ML). The elimination form, $\keyw{ecase}(e)\,\{r\}$, performs simple exhaustive case analysis (we leave support for nested pattern matching as future work) using the auxiliary judgement $\Gamma \vdash_\Theta r \leadsto \dot{r} \Leftarrow \chi \Rightarrow \tau$, which checks that each case in $\chi$ appears in a rules in the rule sequence $r$, rewriting it to the internal rule sequence $\dot{r}$. Every rule must synthesize the same type, $\tau$.

The rule \textit{T-metadata} shows how the appropriate metadata is extracted from the named type context and inserted directly in the elaboration. We will return to the rule \textit{T-toast} when discussing hygiene.

%\subsection{Bidirectional Type System}
%Our type-checking is syntax-directed and it requires terms to be fully annotated with types where necessary. A commonly used approach for making the syntax more compact is bidirectional type systems, . They introduce two mutually recursive judgements: one for expressions that have enough information in the context to synthesize a type, and one for expressions for which we know what type to expect, thus only needing to check against that type. Unique types can be determined for synthesis expressions, while analytical expressions have to be verified to have the right types. We chose to use bidirectional type systems in our formalism because they leverage the simplicity of syntax-directed type-checking while not needing to carry much additional type information.
%
%In conventional bidirectional type systems, for constructors of a type one can propagate the type information $\tau$
%into the term $e$, which means it should be used in the analysis
%judgment $e \Leftarrow \tau$. When constructing a type, we do not have information about it and it is intuitive to use the analysis judgement, which is weaker than the synthesis judgement. On the other hand, destructors generate a result of a smaller type from a component of larger type and can be used for synthesis, propagating type information away from the term as in the synthesis judgement $e \Rightarrow \tau$. Our static semantics rules follow this conventional way of reasoning about constructors and destructors.

\subsection{Defining a TSL Manually}
\input{statics}
In the example in Fig. \ref{f-htmltype}, we showed a TSL being defined using a parser generator using an Adams grammar. As we noted, a parser generator can itself be seen as a TSL for a parser, and a parser is the fundamental construct that becomes associated with a type to form a TSL. The signature for the built-in type \li{Parser} is shown in Fig. 7. It is an object type with a \li{parse} function taking in a \li{TokenStream} and producing an AST of a Wyvern expression, which is of type \li{Exp}. This built-in type is shown also in Fig. 7. Note that there is a form for each form in the abstract syntax, $e$, as well as an \li{Error} form for indicating error messages (in the theory, nothing is done with these messages). As previously mentioned, quasiquotes are merely a TSL that allows one to construct the abstract syntax, represented as this case type, using concrete syntax, with the addition of an unquote mechanism.

The \verb|parse| function for a type $t$ is called when checking a literal form against that type. This is seen in the key rule of our statics: \textit{T-lit}, in Fig. 9. The premises of these rules operate as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
\item This rule uses some built-in types. We first ensure they are available.
\item A well-typed, rewritten parser object is extracted from the type's metadata. This is the step where the parser generator rewrites a grammar to a parse method, recursively using the TSL mechanism itself.
\item A tokenstream, of type \li{TokenStream}, is generated from the body of the literal. This type is an object that that allows the reading of tokens, as well as an additional method discussed in the next section for parsing the stream as a Wyvern expression.
\item The \li|parse| method is called with this extracted tokenstream to produce a syntax tree and a remaining tokenstream.
\item The syntax tree, $\hat{e}'$ is \emph{dereified} into its corresponding term, $e$ (the hat is gone because the generated syntax tree might itself use TSLs). This is the only way terms of the form $\keyw{fromTS}(e)$ can be generated (see below).
\item The dereified term is then recursively typechecked against the same type and rewritten, consistent with the semantics of TSLs as we have been describing them -- they must produce a term of the type they are being checked against. It is checked under the empty local context to ensure hygiene (below).
\item The TSL must consume the entire token stream, so this is checked.
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Statics for translational terms, $\ih$. Each rule in Fig. \ref{fig:statics1} corresponds to an analagous rule here by threading the outer context through opaquely (e.g. the rules for variables and functions, shown here). The outer context is only used by the rules for $\keyw{spliced}[e]$, representing external terms that were spliced into TSL bodies. Only these terms can access outer variables, achieving hygiene (see text). Note that elaboration is implicitly capture-avoiding here (we assume globally unique names for internal variables can be generated whenever necessary, see Sec. \ref{s:implementation}).}
\label{fig:staticsHat}
\end{figure}

A concern with any term rewriting system is \emph{hygiene} -- how should variables in the generated AST be bound? In particular, if the rewriting system generates an \emph{open term}, then it is making assumptions about the names of variables in scope at the site where the TSL is being used, which is incorrect - those variables should only be identifiable up to alpha renaming. Only the \emph{user} of a TSL knows which variables are in scope. Strict hygiene would simply reject all open terms, but this would prevent even nested Wyvern expressions which the user provided from referring to local variables.

The solution to being able to capture variables in portions of the tokenstream that are parsed as Wyvern only is to add a new term to the abstract syntax that has no corresponding form in the concrete syntax: $\keyw{fromTS}(e)$. This means: "this is a term that was parsed from the user's tokenstream". It can be generated by calling \li{ts.as_wyv_exp(tok)}, which returns a the remaining tokenstream as well as the value  \li{Exp.FromTS(ts, tok)}. When we dereify this term, we turn this into the form $\keyw{fromTS}(e)$, where $e$ is the result of parsing the tokenstream as a Wyvern expression until an unexpected token \li{tok} appears.

When we attempt to typecheck this form, which will be starting from an empty local variable context by moving all the available variables into the surrounding variable context (in the \textit{T-Lit} rule, above), we add in the bindings available in the surrounding variable context (to any that were introduced by the TSL, such as the TSL for \li{Parser} does with named non-terminals). In other words, variables in the surrounding variable context can only be used within a term of the form $\keyw{fromTS}(e)$. These variables are precisely those that only the user can know exist, but not the extension.

For this mechanism to truly ensure hygiene, one must not be able to sidestep it by generating a tokenstream manually: expressions from a tokenstream must have actually come from the use site. This is ensured by preventing users from checking \li{new} against \li{TokenStream} in the statics.

A second facet of hygiene is being able to refer to local variables available within the parser itself, such as local helper functions, for convenience. This can be done using the primitive $\keyw{valAST}(e)$. The semantics for this, shown in Fig. 13, first evaluate $e$ to a value, then \emph{reify} this value to an AST. This can be used to ``bake in'' a value known at compile time into the generated code safely. The rules for reification, used here, and dereification, used in the literal rule described above, are essentially dual, as seen in Figs. 11 and 12.

\end{figure}

The semantics we have defined constitute a type safe language.

We begin with a lemma that shows that the statics for $e$ and $\hat{e}$ are consistent. This makes us sure that the splitting of variable contexts to maintain hygiene was done correctly (because they can be brought back together at the end). 
\begin{lemma}[Forward Consistency]
\begin{enumerate}
\item \hspace{-5px}
If $\vdash \Delta$ and $\Delta \vdash \Gamma'$ and $\Delta \vdash \Gamma$ and $\Delta; \Gamma'; \Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau \leadsto \hat{e}$ then $\Delta; \Gamma', \Gamma \vdash \hat{e} : \tau$. 
\item \hspace{-5px} If $\vdash \Delta$ and $\Delta \vdash \Gamma'$ and $\Delta \vdash \Gamma$ and $\Delta; \Gamma'; \Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau \leadsto \hat{e}$ then $\Delta; \Gamma', \Gamma \vdash \hat{e} : \tau$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Forward consistency is easily seen by observing that for each form shared by both $e$ and $\hat{e}$, the bidirectional system simply rewrites to the corresponding form of $\hat{e}$ recursively. Thus, these cases are direct applications of the IH. For the literal form, we can apply the IH to arrive at the fact that $\Delta_0, \Delta; \Gamma', \Gamma, \emptyset \vdash \hat{e} : t$ which by congruence (removing the empty context at the end) is what we wish to show. Similarly, for the form $\keyw{fromTS}(e)$ we have by the IH that $\Delta; \emptyset, \Gamma', \Gamma \vdash \hat{e} : \tau$ which again implies what we wish to show by simple congruence of contexts.
% TODO: err, maybe? I think fromTS might be a bit more complex
\end{proof}

We then need to show type safety of $\hat{e}$. Because it doesn't contain any non-standard terms other than $\keyw{valAST}$ and $t.\keyw{metadata}$, both of which have straightforward semantics (Fig. 13), this follows by the standard progress and preservation techniques. The only tricky case is \textit{Dyn-valAST2}, which requires the following straightforward lemma about the reification rules in Fig. 12, as well as standard structural properties for the contexts (weakening; not shown).
\begin{lemma}[Reification]
If $\hat{e} \triangleright \hat{e}'$ then $\Delta_0; \emptyset \vdash \hat{e}' : Exp$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Preservation]
If $\vdash \Delta$ and $\Delta; \emptyset \vdash \hat{e} : \tau$ and  $\hat{e} \xmapsto[\Delta]{} \hat{e}'$ then $\Delta; \emptyset \vdash \hat{e}' : \tau$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}[Progress]
If  $\vdash \Delta$ and $\Delta; \emptyset \vdash \hat{e} : \tau$ then either $\hat{e}~\texttt{val}$ or $\hat{e} \xmapsto[\Delta]{} \hat{e}'$.
\end{lemma}
These lemmas and associated judgements can be lifted to the level of programs by applying them to the top-level expression the program contains (simple, not shown). As a result, we have type safety: well-typed programs cannot ``get stuck''.
\begin{theorem}[Type Safety]
If $\Delta_0 \vdash \rho : \tau \leadsto \hat{\rho}$ then $\Delta_0 \vdash \hat{\rho} : \tau$ and either $\hat{\rho}~\texttt{val}$ or $\hat{\rho} \xmapsto[\Delta_0]{} \hat{\rho}'$ such that $\Delta_0 \vdash \hat{\rho}' : \tau$.
\end{theorem}
\subsection{Decidability}
Because we are executing user-defined parsers during typechecking, we do not have a straightforward statement of decidability (i.e. termination) of typechecking. The parser might not terminate, or it might generate a term that contains itself. Non-decidability is strictly due to user-defined parsing code. Typechecking of programs that do not contain literals is guaranteed to terminate, as is typechecking of $\hat{e}$ (which we do not actually need to do in practice by Lemma 1). Termination of parsers and parser generators has previously been studied (e.g. \cite{DBLP:conf/sle/KrishnanW12}) and the techniques can be applied to user-defined parsing code to increase confidence in termination. Few compilers, even those with high demands for correctness (e.g. CompCert \cite{Leroy-Compcert-CACM}), have made it a priority to fully verify and prove termination of the parser. This is because it is perceived that most bugs in compilers arise due to incorrect optimization passes, not initial parsing and elaboration logic.
