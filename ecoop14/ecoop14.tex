\begin{abstract}
%The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should
%contain at least 70 and at most 150 words. It should be written using the
%\emph{abstract} environment.
Programming languages often include specialized notation for common datatypes (e.g. lists) and some also build in support for specific specialized datatypes (e.g. regular expressions), but user-defined types must use general-purpose notations. Frustration with this causes developers to use strings, rather than structured representations, with alarming frequency, leading to correctness, performance, security and usability  issues.
Allowing developers to modularly extend a language with new notations could help address these issues. Unfortunately, prior mechanisms either limit expressiveness or are not safely composable: individually-unambiguous extensions can cause ambiguities when used together. We introduce \emph{type-specific languages}:  logic associated with a type that determines how \emph{generic literal forms}, capable of containing arbitrary syntax, should be parsed and expanded into general-purpose syntax. The TSL for a type is invoked only when a literal appears where a term of that type is expected, guaranteeing non-interference. We give evidence supporting the applicability of  this approach and specify it with a bidirectional type system for an emerging language, Wyvern.
%
%Domain-specific languages can improve ease-of-use, expressiveness and verifiability, but defining and using different DSLs within a single application remains difficult.
%
%We introduce an approach for embedding DSLs in a common host language where the type of a piece of domain-specific code can specify which grammar governs it. Because this grammar is type-specific, but the block is delimited by the host language, we can guarantee that link-time conflicts cannot arise. These grammars can recursively include top-level expressions using special entry tokens that guarantee that the composition of the type-specific language and the host language is also sound. We argue that this approach occupies a previously-unexplored sweet spot providing high expressiveness and ease-of-use while guaranteeing safety. We introduce the design, provide examples, sketch the safety theorems and describe an ongoing implementation of this strategy in the Wyvern programming language.

%We introduce an approach for embedded DSLs where 1) whitespace delimits DSL-governed blocks, and 2) the parsing and type checking phases occur in tandem so that the expected type of the block determines which domain-specific parser governs that block.
%We argue that this approach occupies a sweet spot, providing   
%high expressiveness and ease-of-use while maintaining safe composability. We introduce the design, provide examples and describe an ongoing implementation of this strategy in the Wyvern programming language. We also discuss how a more conventional keyword-directed strategy for parsing of DSLs can arise as a special case of this type-directed strategy.
